# image-classification-transformers
classifying cats and dogs images using TinyVGG architecture with Pytorch
We are using kagglecatsanddogs_3367a dataset
After extaction there are two files named "Dog" and "cat"
At first we are going to make two seprate directories for test and train datasets
Then we will randomly choose 10% of the dataset for testset 
And finally we will replicate the TinyVGG model with PyTorch
